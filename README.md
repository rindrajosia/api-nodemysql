# Excellence Technologies

This project is about using expressjs with mysql. I have design database tables based on requirements.

## Databse:

1] First you need to create DB called excellence:

* CREATE DATABASE excellence;

2] Import excellence.sql into your MySQL or, you can just copy and past the content of this file inside your sql terminal.

4] In this project, we have 3 tables:
* a] 'candidate table' that contains information about candidate.
* b] 'note table that' join candidate table and round tables. It stores also the score of candidate.
* c] 'round table that contains list of round.
